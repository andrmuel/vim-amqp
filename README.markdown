# amqp.vim

amqp.vim provides a simple interface to AMQP from within Vim.

It provides the following commands:

* `:AMQPGet` - get an event from AMQP
* `:AMQPPublish` - publish an event to AMQP

## Installation

I recommend using [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen):

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/andrmuel/vim-curl.git

## Bugs

I have only used this script with RabbitMQ and not tested it very much. Bugs
are likely.
